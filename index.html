			 <p>This <a href="https://kottke.org/23/04/emily-wilsons-translation-of-the-iliad">new translation of The Iliad</a> looks very interesting. I&rsquo;m curious to look into Wilson&rsquo;s creative process as well.</p>

			 <p>I keep thinking about <a href="https://www.todayintabs.com/p/bitcoin-is-commoditized-waste">this description</a> of Bitcoin&rsquo;s value:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s a popular myth that a Bitcoin’s value is based on nothing, just pulled out of thin air by math. But that’s not true—Bitcoin is a way to commoditize energy consumption without accidentally producing anything useful. Other energy-intensive industries tend to convert energy into useful materials like aluminum or cement. Bitcoin converts electricity into waste heat and records its destruction in the form of numbers, which can then be traded for other numbers but not used to make anything people need or converted back into energy.</p>

			 <p>Currently reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781609383473">First We Read, Then We Write</a> by Robert D. Richardson 📚</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But we live after all in that &ldquo;weary kingdom of time,&rdquo; and Emerson&rsquo;s idea of art, of poetry, fits satisfyingly into this world as he says, in the essay&rsquo;s high point and culminating line, &ldquo;Art is the path of the creator to his work.&rdquo; One cannot not repeat it enough; art is not the finished work, art is the getting there.</p>

			 <p>According to <a href="https://www.bigtechnology.com/p/social-media-is-changing-and-paid">this post</a>, most social media content is produced by professional creators these days.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The reactions all missed the underlying shift behind the move: Social media feeds, once filled with content from ordinary users, are now programmed primarily by professional creators. These creators need identity verification, customer service, and visibility boosting. And they’re willing to pay. Meta is simply filling the need.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(<a href="https://www.bigtechnology.com/p/social-media-is-changing-and-paid">https://www.bigtechnology.com/p/social-media-is-changing-and-paid</a>)</p>
<p>Does this require a reconsideration of what defines social media? Professionalism is not how social media was built, but it is what Meta and Twitter are becoming. I think this illustrates the differences that can be found with platforms like Mastodon &amp; Micro.blog quite nicely.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve been around for a bit now at Micro.blog, but not really said anything.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s change that! I&rsquo;m Matt, a lapsed journalist of sorts who does other things now. Things that interest me most at the moment are tech, media, China, and philosophy (not necessarily in that order).</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s nice to be here!</p>
