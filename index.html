<blockquote>
<p>But we live after all in that &ldquo;weary kingdom of time,&rdquo; and Emerson&rsquo;s idea of art, of poetry, fits satisfyingly into this world as he says, in the essay&rsquo;s high point and culminating line, &ldquo;Art is the path of the creator to his work.&rdquo; One cannot not repeat it enough; art is not the finished work, art is the getting there.</p>

			 <p>According to <a href="https://www.bigtechnology.com/p/social-media-is-changing-and-paid">this post</a>, most social media content is produced by professional creators these days.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The reactions all missed the underlying shift behind the move: Social media feeds, once filled with content from ordinary users, are now programmed primarily by professional creators. These creators need identity verification, customer service, and visibility boosting. And theyâ€™re willing to pay. Meta is simply filling the need.</p>

<p>Does this require a reconsideration of what defines social media? Professionalism is not how social media was built, but it is what Meta and Twitter are becoming. I think this illustrates the differences that can be found with platforms like Mastodon &amp; Micro.blog quite nicely.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve been around for a bit now at Micro.blog, but not really said anything.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s change that! I&rsquo;m Matt, a lapsed journalist of sorts who does other things now. Things that interest me most at the moment are tech, media, China, and philosophy (not necessarily in that order).</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s nice to be here!</p>
